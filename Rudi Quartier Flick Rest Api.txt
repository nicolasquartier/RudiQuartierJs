Hi,
I want to create my own non-commercial site with my own domain,
where I can display all my photos and for this I would invoke calls to the rest api.

It would work as a kind of a photo booth. At the home page, visitors would see an overview of about 20 pictures.Visitors can click a specific photo and then it would zoom in to that picture, so you can see it in detail.
The photo booth is to show all my pictures of my sculptures that I make by hand.

Thanks in advance!
